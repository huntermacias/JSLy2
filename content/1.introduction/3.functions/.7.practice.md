## Objectives
By the end of this exercise, students will be able to:

- Understand and use [arrow functions](https://jsly.vercel.app/introduction/functions/arrow-functions).
- Implement and utilize [callback functions](https://jsly.vercel.app/introduction/functions/callback-functions).
- Work with [default parameters](https://jsly.vercel.app/introduction/functions/default-parameters) in functions.
- Create and apply [higher order functions](https://jsly.vercel.app/introduction/functions/higher-order-functions).

### Scenario
SmartHome Inc. wants to automate the following tasks:

Control the lights based on time of day.
Adjust the thermostat based on the weather.
Manage a list of devices and perform various operations on them.


## Tasks


### 1. Control the Lights
Create a function `controlLights` that takes the current hour as an argument and returns a message indicating whether the lights should be turned on or off. Use [default parameters](https://jsly.vercel.app/introduction/functions/default-parameters) to set the default hour to the current hour.

### 2. Adjust the Thermostat
Create a function `adjustThermostat` that takes the current temperature and a [callback function](https://jsly.vercel.app/introduction/functions/callback-function). The callback function should determine whether to turn the heating or cooling on or off. Use [arrow functions](https://jsly.vercel.app/introduction/functions/arrow-functions) for the callback.

### 3. Manage Devices
Create a [higher order function](https://jsly.vercel.app/introduction/functions/higher-order-functions) `manageDevices` that takes an array of device names and a callback function to perform operations on each device. The callback function should accept a device name and perform an operation, such as turning the device on or off.

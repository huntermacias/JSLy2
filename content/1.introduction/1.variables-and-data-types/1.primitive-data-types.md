title: primitive data types
description: "In JavaScript, objects can have properties that are functions. These properties are called methods. Methods allow objects to encapsulate behavior and perform actions using their own data. This section will guide you through the basics of creating and using object methods, with practical examples and best practices."
---


## String

A string represents textual data. Strings are created by enclosing the text in single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or backticks (`` ` ``).

  
  ```js [strings.js]
  let username = 'HunterMacias';
  let greeting = "Hello, world!";
  let templateLiteral = `Hello, ${username}!`;
  ```

  Strings can also include special characters like new lines (\n), tabs (\t), and Unicode characters (\u).

  ```js [strings.js] 
  let multiline = `This is a
  multiline string.`;
  console.log(multiline); // This is a
                          // multiline string.

  ```


## Number
A number represents both integer and floating-point values.

```js [number.js] copy
let age = 30; // Integer
let pi = 3.14159; // Float
let hex = 0xff;  // Hexadecimal
let binary = 0b1010;  // Binary
let octal = 0o17;  // Octal
```
Numbers also include special values like Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN (Not-a-Number).


##### Quirk
JavaScript uses 64-bit floating-point representation, which can lead to precision issues:
```js [number-quirks.js] copy
console.log(0.1 + 0.2); // 0.30000000000000004
```

## Boolean
A boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.

```js [booleans.js] copy
let isLoggedIn = true;
let isPremiumUser = false;
```
Booleans are often used in conditional statements to control the flow of a program.
```js [booleans.js] copy
if (isLoggedIn) {
  console.log('User is logged in.');
} else {
  console.log('User is not logged in.');
}
```



## Null
null is a special value that represents "no value" or "nothing".
```js [null.js] copy
let selectedProduct = null;
```

Null is often used to indicate that a variable should have an object or value, but that it is not currently available.

## Undefined
Undefined means a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value.
```js [undefined.js] copy
let customerName;
console.log(customerName); // undefined
```

##### Quirk
If you try to access an object property that doesn't exist, you'll get undefined.
```js [undefined.js] copy
let user = { name: 'HunterMacias' };
console.log(user.age); // undefined
```
##### Example
Let's explore a more detailed example to understand how undefined works in different scenarios:
```js [undefined.js] copy
// Variable declared but not initialized
let product;
console.log(product); // undefined

// Function with no return statement
function greet() {
  let message = "Hello!";
}
let greeting = greet();
console.log(greeting); // undefined

// Accessing a non-existent property of an object
let userProfile = {
  username: 'HunterMacias',
  email: 'hunter@example.com'
};
console.log(userProfile.age); // undefined

```

## Symbol
Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value, often used as object keys.
```js [undefined.js] copy
let uniqueId = Symbol('id');

let user = {
  name: 'HunterMacias',
  age: 30,
  isLoggedIn: true,
  address: null,
  id: Symbol('id')
};
```
Symbols are primarily used to create unique property keys that won't conflict with other property keys.

##### Understanding these primitive data types is crucial for working effectively in JavaScript. They form the basis of more complex data structures and operations.


## FAQ

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: Can I use single and double quotes interchangeably?</strong></summary>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, but be consistent to avoid confusion. Backticks are useful for template literals and multi-line strings.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: Why does `0.1 + 0.2` not equal `0.3` exactly?</strong></summary>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> This is due to the way JavaScript handles floating-point arithmetic. It's a common issue with many programming languages that use binary floating-point numbers.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: How is `null` different from `undefined`?</strong></summary>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> `null` is an assignment value that means "no value" or "nothing", while `undefined` means a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: Why is understanding primitive data types important?</strong></summary>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Knowing how these data types work helps you write more efficient and bug-free code. Each type has specific properties and behaviors that can impact how your programs run.</p>

title: Proxy Pattern
description: Intercept and control interactions to target objects

## Overview

The `Proxy Pattern` uses a `Proxy` to intercept and control interactions with target objects.

Let's say that we have a person object. We can access properties with either dot or bracket notation:

and modify property values in a similar fashion:

With the Proxy pattern, we don't want to interact with this object directly. Instead, a Proxy object intercepts the request and (optionally) forwards this to the target object - the `person` object in this case.

## Implementation

In JavaScript, we can easily create a new proxy by using the built-in `Proxy` object.

![Proxy Pattern](https://javascriptpatterns.vercel.app/design-patterns/proxy-pattern/001.png)

The `Proxy` object receives two arguments:

1. The target object
2. A handler object, which we can use to add functionality to the proxy. This object comes with some built-in functions that we can use, such as `get` and `set`.

The `get` method on the handler object gets invoked when we want to access a property, and the `set` method gets invoked when we want to modify a property.

```js [proxy-implementation.js]
const person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 42,
  email: "john@doe.com",
  country: "Canada",
};

const personProxy = new Proxy(person, {
  get: (target, prop) => {
    console.log(`The value of ${prop} is ${target[prop]}`);
    return target[prop];
  },
  set: (target, prop, value) => {
    console.log(`Changed ${prop} from ${target[prop]} to ${value}`);
    target[prop] = value;
    return true;
  },
});
```

The `Proxy` object receives two arguments:

1. The target object
2. A handler object, which we can use to add functionality to the proxy. This object comes with some built-in functions that we can use, such as `get` and `set`.
The `get` method on the handler object gets invoked when we want to access a property, and the `set` method gets invoked when we want to modify a property.

```js [proxy-implementation.js] copy
const person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 42,
  email: "john@doe.com",
  country: "Canada",
};

const personProxy = new Proxy(person, {
  get: (target, prop) => {
    console.log(`The value of ${prop} is ${target[prop]}`);
    return target[prop];
  },
  set: (target, prop, value) => {
    console.log(`Changed ${prop} from ${target[prop]} to ${value}`);
    target[prop] = value;
    return true;
  },
});
```

### `Reflect`
The built-in `Reflect` object makes it easier to manipulate the target object.

Instead of accessing properties through `obj[prop]` or setting properties through `obj[prop] = value`, we can access or modify properties on the target object through `Reflect.get()` and `Reflect.set()`. The methods receive the same arguments as the methods on the handler object.

## Tradeoffs

::alert{type="success"}
✔ <strong>Control</strong>: Proxies make it easy to add functionality when interacting with a certain object, such as validation, logging, formatting, notifications, debugging.
::

::alert{type="warning"}
⚠️ <strong>Long handler execution</strong>: Executing handlers on every object interaction could lead to performance issues.
::

## Exercise

### Challenge

Add the following validation to the `user` object:

- The `username` property has to be a `string` that only contains of letters, and is at least 3 characters long
- The `email` property has to be a valid email address.
- The `age` property has to be a number, and has to be at least `18`
- When a property is retrieved, change the output to `${new Date()} | The value of ${property}}` is $`{target[property]}`. For example if we get `user.name`, it needs to log `2022-05-31T15:29:15.303Z | The value of name is John`

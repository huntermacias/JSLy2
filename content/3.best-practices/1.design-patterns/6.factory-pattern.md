title: Factory Pattern
description: Use a factory function in order to create objects
---

### Overview

With the Factory Pattern, we can use a special function - the factory function - to create many of the same objects.

### Implementation

A factory function can be any function that returns an object.

```js [factory-pattern.js] copy
const createUser = (firstName, lastName) => ({
  id: crypto.randomUUID(),
  createdAt: Date.now(),
  firstName,
  lastName,
  fullName: `${firstName} ${lastName}`,
});

createUser("John", "Doe");
createUser("Sarah", "Doe");
createUser("Lydia", "Hallie");
```

### Tradeoffs

::alert{type="success"}
✔ <strong class='text-white'>DRY</strong> The factory pattern is useful when we have to create multiple
  objects that share the same properties, without having to repeat the same code
  over and over. A factory function can easily return a custom object depending
  on the current environment, or user-specific configuration.
::

::alert{type=""}
⚠️ <strong class='text-white'>Not Really a Pattern</strong> In JavaScript, the factory pattern isn't much more than a function that returns an object without using the new keyword. ES6 arrow functions allow us to create small factory functions that implicitly return an object each time.



However, in many cases it may be more memory efficient to create new instances instead of new objects each time.

```js [user.js] copy
class User {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, email) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.email = email;
  }

  async getPosts() {
    const posts = await fetch(`https://my.cms.com/posts/user/${this.id}`);
    return posts;
  }
}

const user1 = new User({
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  email: "john@doe.com",
});

const user2 = new User({
  firstName: "Jane",
  lastName: "Doe",
  email: "jane@doe.com",
});
```

The `fullName` method is the same for all the objects that were created. By creating new instances, the `fullName` method is available on the prototype instead of on the objec, which saves memory.

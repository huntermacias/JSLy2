title: JavaScript Closures
description: Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allow functions to retain access to their lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope. This guide will introduce you to the basics of closures, how to use them, and why they are important.

## What is a Closure?

A closure is a function that captures the lexical environment in which it was created. This means that a closure has access to variables defined in its outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing.

## Creating Closures

### Basic Example

```js [closure-basic.js] copy
function outerFunction() {
  const outerVariable = 'I am from the outer scope';

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable);
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

const closure = outerFunction();
closure(); // "I am from the outer scope"
```

<div class='explanation'>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><code>function outerFunction()</code></strong> creates an outer scope where <code>outerVariable</code> is defined.</li>
    <li><strong><code>function innerFunction()</code></strong> is defined inside <code>outerFunction</code> and has access to <code>outerVariable</code>.</li>
    <li>When <strong><code>innerFunction</code></strong> is returned and assigned to <code>closure</code>, it retains access to <code>outerVariable</code>.</li>
  </ul>
</div>


## Practical Uses of Closures
### Data Privacy
Closures can be used to create private variables that cannot be accessed directly from outside the function.
```js [data-privacy.js] copy
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  return {
    increment: function() {
      count += 1;
      return count;
    },
    decrement: function() {
      count -= 1;
      return count;
    },
    getCount: function() {
      return count;
    }
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter.increment()); // 1
console.log(counter.decrement()); // 0
console.log(counter.getCount()); // 0
```

<div class='explanation'>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><code>let count = 0;</code></strong> initializes a private variable.</li>
    <li>The returned object contains methods that form closures over the <code>count</code> variable.</li>
    <li>The private <code>count</code> variable can only be accessed and modified using these methods.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: How do closures work?</strong></summary>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Closures work by capturing the variables in their lexical scope. When the function is executed, it can reference these captured variables, maintaining access to them even if they are not in the immediate scope.</p>

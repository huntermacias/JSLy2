description: "In JavaScript, `objects` are essentially collections of key/value pairs. These values can include properties and methods, incorporating all other JavaScript data types such as `strings`, `numbers`, and `Booleans`."

---

Every object in JavaScript inherits from the parent Object constructor. The Object constructor comes with a suite of handy built-in methods that simplify working with individual objects. Unlike methods for arrays, such as `sort()` and `reverse()`, which are called on array instances, Object methods are called directly on the Object constructor itself, with the object instance passed as an argument. These are known as static methods.


### Object Literals

---

The simplest way to create an object is using an object literal.

```js [object-literals.js] copy
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  job: "Developer"
};

console.log(person);
```

### Using the Object Constructor
---
Another way to create an object is by using the Object constructor.
```js [object-constructor.js] copy
const person = new Object();
person.name = "John";
person.age = 30;
person.job = "Developer";

console.log(person);
```
---

## Accessing Object Properties
### Dot Notation
The most common way to access properties is using dot notation.
```js [dot-notation.js] copy
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  job: "Developer"
};

console.log(person.name); // "John"
console.log(person.age); // 30
```

### Bracket Notation
---
You can also access properties using bracket notation, which is useful when property names are dynamic or not valid identifiers.

```js [bracket-notation.js] copy
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  job: "Developer"
};

console.log(person["name"]); // "John"
console.log(person["age"]); // 30

const property = "job";
console.log(person[property]); // "Developer"
```

---
## Modifying Object Properties
### Adding and Updating Properties
---
You can add new properties or update existing ones using either dot or bracket notation.
```js [modify-obj-prop.js] copy
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

person.job = "Developer"; // Adding a new property
person.age = 31; // Updating an existing property

console.log(person);
```

### Deleting Properties
---
To remove a property from an object, use the delete operator.

```js [del-props.js] copy
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  job: "Developer"
};

delete person.job;

console.log(person); // { name: "John", age: 30 }
```

## Checking for Properties
---
### `in`{lang=ts} Operator

The `in`{lang=ts} operator checks if a property exists in an object.

```js [in-operator.js] copy
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

console.log("name" in person); // true
console.log("job" in person); // false
```

### `hasOwnProperty()`{lang=ts} Method

The `hasOwnProperty()`{lang=ts} method checks if a property exists as a direct property of the object, not inherited through the prototype chain.

```js [has-own-prop-obj.js] copy
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

console.log(person.hasOwnProperty("name")); // true
console.log(person.hasOwnProperty("job")); // false
```

### Iterating Over Properties
---
`for...in Loop`

The for...in loop iterates over all enumerable properties of an object, including inherited properties.

```js [for-in-loop-js] copy
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  job: "Developer"
};

for (let key in person) {
  if (person.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
  }
}
```

### `Object.keys()`{lang=ts}, `Object.values()`{lang=ts}, and `Object.entries()`{lang=ts}
These methods return arrays of the object's keys, values, and key-value pairs, respectively.
```js [object-methods.js] copy
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  job: "Developer"
};

console.log(Object.keys(person)); // ["name", "age", "job"]
console.log(Object.values(person)); // ["John", 30, "Developer"]
console.log(Object.entries(person)); // [["name", "John"], ["age", 30], ["job", "Developer"]]
```

## Practical Examples
### Managing a To-Do List
Using objects to manage a to-do list with tasks and their statuses.
```js [todo-list.js] copy
const todoList = {
  tasks: [
    { task: "Learn JavaScript", completed: false },
    { task: "Build a project", completed: false }
  ],
  addTask(task) {
    this.tasks.push({ task, completed: false });
  },
  completeTask(taskName) {
    const task = this.tasks.find(t => t.task === taskName);
    if (task) {
      task.completed = true;
    }
  },
  getTasks() {
    return this.tasks;
  }
};

todoList.addTask("Review code");
todoList.completeTask("Learn JavaScript");
console.log(todoList.getTasks());
```

### Game Character Stats
---
Using objects to store and update game character statistics.
```js [game-char-stats.js] copy
const character = {
  name: "Archer",
  level: 1,
  health: 100,
  stats: {
    strength: 10,
    agility: 15,
    intelligence: 12
  },
  levelUp() {
    this.level++;
    this.health += 20;
    this.stats.strength += 2;
    this.stats.agility += 3;
    this.stats.intelligence += 1;
  }
};

character.levelUp();
console.log(character);
```

## FAQ
<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: What is the difference between dot notation and bracket notation?</strong></summary>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Dot notation is more concise and easier to read, but can only be used with valid identifier property names. Bracket notation is more flexible and allows for dynamic property names and property names that are not valid identifiers.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: How do I check if an object has a specific property?</strong></summary>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> You can use the <code>in</code> operator or the <code>hasOwnProperty</code> method to check if an object has a specific property.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: Can objects in JavaScript have methods?</strong></summary>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, objects can have methods, which are functions that belong to the object. These methods can be used to manipulate the object's properties or perform other actions related to the object.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: How can I iterate over an object's properties?</strong></summary>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> You can use a <code>for...in</code> loop to iterate over an object's properties, or use <code>Object.keys</code>, <code>Object.values</code>, and <code>Object.entries</code> to work with arrays of the object's keys, values, and key-value pairs, respectively.</p>
